    <h2>Troubleshooting Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Check Cable Connections:</strong> Ensure all cables (power, Ethernet, coaxial/fiber) are firmly connected to the modem and your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Signal Strength:</strong> Check the signal strength indicators on your modem or through its web interface. If the signal fluctuates, contact your ISP.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool Down Your Modem:</strong> Ensure the modem has proper ventilation and is not placed in a hot or enclosed area.</li>
        <li><strong>Restart Your Modem and Computer:</strong> Power cycle both your modem and computer to refresh their connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Network Drivers:</strong> Ensure your computer's network drivers are up to date. Check the manufacturer's website for the latest drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Software Conflicts:</strong> Temporarily disable any VPNs, firewalls, or antivirus software to see if they are causing the issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Test with Another Device:</strong> Connect a different device (e.g., laptop, smartphone) to the modem to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is with the modem or a specific device.</li>
        <li><strong>Check In-Home Cabling:</strong> Check for damaged or old cables inside the home. Replace if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Test power supply:</strong> try another power outlet, or another identical power supply.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Your ISP:</strong> If the problem continues, contact your ISP to check for network issues in your area.</li>
    </ol>
