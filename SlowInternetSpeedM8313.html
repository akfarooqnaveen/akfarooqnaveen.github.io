    <h2>Troubleshooting Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Restart Your Modem and Router:</strong> Unplug both your modem and router, wait for 30 seconds, and plug them back in.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Network Congestion:</strong> Try using your internet at different times of the day to see if the speed varies. Contact your ISP to check for any known outages or congestion issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize Wi-Fi Signal:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Move your modem to a central location, away from walls and obstructions.</li>
                <li>Change your Wi-Fi channel to avoid interference from neighboring networks.</li>
                <li>Ensure no other electronic devices are interfering.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Update Firmware:</strong> Check your modem manufacturer's website for the latest firmware and follow the instructions to update.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Ethernet Cables:</strong> Ensure all Ethernet cables are securely connected and in good condition. Try swapping cables to test for faults.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Connected Devices:</strong> Disconnect devices that are not actively in use.</li>
        <li><strong>Run a Speed Test:</strong> Use online speed test tools to measure your internet speed and compare it to your subscribed plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Your ISP:</strong> If the problem persists, contact your ISP for further assistance. They can check for issues on their end and provide additional support.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Reset:</strong> As a last resort, perform a factory reset on your modem. (Note: This will erase all custom settings.)</li>
